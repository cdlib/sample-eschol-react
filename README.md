# sample-eschol-react
A sample app showing how the new eScholarship site might use ReactJS, Sinatra, Gulp, etc.

Good places to start browsing in the code:
* templates/*.jsx - in-browser code - the various ReactJS components that make up the pages
* subu.rb - server-side code that connects to the database and serves up parts of it API-style
